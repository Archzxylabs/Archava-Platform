/**
 * `EmailAttemptStore`, backed by PostgreSQL.
 *
 * The port is `packages/act-email/src/outbox.ts` and is unchanged by this file.
 * The email port's `settle` returns a `boolean` rather than a record-and-status
 * pair, so this adapter's shape is slightly different from the booking one's —
 * but the policy underneath is the same `core.ts` for a reason that matters more
 * than the shape difference: both adapters must fail the same way.
 *
 * ## `settle` returns `false` in three situations, and only two are the same
 *
 * `true` — the conditional `UPDATE` matched and moved a row.
 *
 * `false` — one of:
 *
 *   1. **The CAS lost.** Zero rows updated because the record is no longer
 *      `prepared`. This is the ordinary case: another caller settled it as
 *      `accepted` first, or a reconciliation moved it to `unknown`. The record
 *      is perfectly healthy; this writer simply lost. `false` is the correct
 *      answer and the outbox leaves the record alone.
 *   2. **The database would not answer.** Same `false`, because the port has no
 *      third value. This is the case that deserves attention: it is a `false`
 *      that means "nobody knows", and the outbox treats it as exactly that —
 *      the record stays where it is, and recovery is a status read, never a
 *      second send.
 *   3. **A row came back and does not check out.** Also `false`.
 *
 * The port's boolean cannot distinguish these, and that is the port's own
 * choice, so this adapter does not pretend otherwise. What it must never do is
 * return `true` for any of them: a `true` on an error would leave a record
 * claiming a state nobody wrote, and a `true` on a lost CAS would tell the
 * outbox that its write won when it did not — which, combined with the outbox's
 * rule that a settlement implies the send happened, is a fabricated receipt.
 *
 * ## What is never stored
 *
 * No recipient, no template id or provider template id, no sender address, no
 * message body, no provider credential, and no fingerprint key. The recipient is
 * exactly what the port's own docstring says a durable store has no reason to
 * hold; this adapter holds the digest and nothing else. The pipeline's raw
 * idempotency key may contain inputs, so the SQL key is its separate HMAC.
