/**
 * `BookingAttemptStore`, backed by PostgreSQL.
 *
 * The port it implements is in `packages/act-booking/src/replay.ts` and is
 * unchanged by this file. What this file adds is the durability that port's own
 * docstring says an in-memory map cannot provide: `claim` is one
 * `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`, so whether this caller owns the
 * key is decided by a unique index and not by a read that could race.
 *
 * ## The three answers, and which one means what
 *
 * `{ status: 'accepted' }` — the insert returned a row, so this caller owns the
 * only reservation this key will ever make.
 *
 * `{ status: 'replayed', attempt }` — the insert returned nothing, because
 * somebody already owns the key. The adapter then reads that owner's record and
 * hands it back. It does not retry the insert, does not overwrite the row, and
 * does not touch the booking system.
 *
 * `throw` — the database would not answer, or answered with a row that does not
 * check out. The boundary above wraps `claim` in a try/catch and turns a throw
 * into `booking_outcome_unknown`. That is the correct outcome: a store that
 * cannot say whether a key is taken cannot promise at most one reservation, so
 * the honest thing is to report that nobody knows and make nothing.
 *
 * The throw is deliberate. An adapter that returned `accepted` on an error
 * would let two processes both believe they owned the key — and the boundary
 * above would then make two reservations. An adapter that returned `replayed`
 * with an invented record would report a booking that was never made. There is
 * no safe third option, so there is no silent path.
 *
 * ## Why `settle` can return `stale` but never throws for it
 *
 * `BookingAttemptSettlementResult` has `settled` and `stale`, and `stale`
 * carries the current record so the caller can resolve from what is durable
 * rather than from what it last saw. Zero rows updated is `stale` — an answer,
 * not an error, because `UPDATE` does not error on matching nothing. A thrown
 * error is the unavailable case, and it means "nobody knows whether that write
 * landed".
 *
 * ## What is never stored
 *
 * No slot, no customer reference, no notes, no booking reference from anywhere
 * but the authoritative system, and no fingerprint key. The fingerprint column
 * holds a keyed digest that this package did not compute and cannot invert.
 * The pipeline's raw idempotency key contains action inputs, so this adapter
 * stores only its separate tenant/action-bound HMAC in the key column.
 *
 * **This is server-side code.** It holds tenant ids, and it is constructed with
 * a database credential by the server composition. It must not reach a bundle.
