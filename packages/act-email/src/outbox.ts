/**
 * The outbox and replay boundary around `EmailGateway`.
 *
 * The executor hands this boundary the same `EmailSendRequest` every time the
 * same turn is replayed, and the same `idempotencyKey` with it. What has to be
 * true, and what this file is for:
 *
 * 1. **One key, one message.** A key, once claimed, never reaches the provider
 *    twice. Not from a concurrent caller, not from a process that restarted
 *    mid-send, not from a visitor pressing the button twice.
 * 2. **The same key and the same payload replay.** The second caller gets the
 *    message id the provider issued, served from the record with no write
 *    anywhere. That id is the authoritative idempotent receipt: it is the one
 *    thing that says the message already went, and it came from the provider.
 * 3. **The same key and a different recipient or template is a conflict.** A key
 *    that arrives carrying a different address, template or sender is not a
 *    replay of anything; it is a bug or a forgery, and it is refused rather than
 *    served. A conflict never reads as a success.
 * 4. **An unknown outcome is never laundered into a success, and never re-sent.**
 *    If nobody knows how the first attempt ended, the next caller is told nobody
 *    knows. A replay may look again — through the provider's status, or through a
 *    receipt the provider already issued — but looking is the only thing it may
 *    do. Silence stays silence.
 * 5. **`accepted` is the provider's word only.** It means a transport accepted a
 *    message. It does not mean an inbox, a read, or a delivery: nothing in this
 *    package can see any of those, and the boundary that claimed otherwise would
 *    be claiming something it has no evidence for.
 *
 * The boundary implements `EmailGateway` itself, which is the point: an executor
 * cannot tell the difference between a raw gateway and a wrapped one, so the
 * existing public executor contract does not change and every caller that
 * already holds an executor keeps working.
 *
 * **This is server-side code.** The attempt store holds tenant-scoped identities
 * and the transport carries tenant credentials. Neither belongs in a browser
 * bundle, and neither is decided here.
 *
 * No per-request state is kept on the instance. Two callers may share one
 * boundary and interleave freely, and which attempt each is is carried in the
 * arguments rather than held where the other could overwrite it.
