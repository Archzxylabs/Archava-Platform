/**
 * The replay and reconciliation boundary around `BookingGateway`.
 *
 * The executor hands this boundary the same `BookingReservationRequest` every
 * time the same turn is replayed, and the same `idempotencyKey` with it. What
 * has to be true, and what this file is for:
 *
 * 1. **One attempt, one reservation.** A key, once claimed, never issues a
 *    second reservation. Not from a concurrent caller, not from a process that
 *    restarted mid-flight, not from a user pressing the button twice.
 * 2. **The same key and the same payload replay.** A second caller gets the
 *    answer the first one got — the reference the authoritative system issued,
 *    never a reference this package minted.
 * 3. **The same key and a different payload is a conflict.** A key that arrives
 *    carrying a different slot, customer or note is not a replay of anything;
 *    it is a bug or a forgery, and it is refused rather than served.
 * 4. **An unknown outcome is never laundered into a success.** If nobody knows
 *    how the first attempt ended, a later caller is told nobody knows — unless
 *    the authoritative system has since looked the original attempt up and
 *    reconciled it. Only then is a reference reported, and it is still the
 *    system's reference, not ours.
 *
 * The boundary implements `BookingGateway` itself, which is the point: an
 * executor cannot tell the difference between a raw gateway and a wrapped one,
 * so the existing public executor contract is unchanged and every caller that
 * already holds an executor keeps working.
 *
 * **This is server-side code.** The attempt store holds tenant-scoped
 * identifiers and the reconciler speaks with tenant credentials. Neither
 * belongs in a browser bundle, and neither is decided here.
 *
 * No per-request state is kept on the instance. Two callers may share one
 * boundary and interleave freely, and which attempt each is is carried in the
 * arguments rather than held where the other could overwrite it.
