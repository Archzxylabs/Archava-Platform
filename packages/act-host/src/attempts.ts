/**
 * The attempt ledger — the only thing that remembers a turn's time.
 *
 * `runTurn` takes an `occurredAt`, and an idempotency key is derived from it.
 * That makes the timestamp a *decision*, not a reading: derive it twice and the
 * same visitor action produces two idempotency keys, which is precisely how a
 * timeout after a booking turns into a second booking. The ledger exists so the
 * decision is made once, written down, and read back unchanged on every retry.
 *
 * What it stores is deliberately tiny, and the omissions are the design:
 *
 * - the identity — tenant, session, action id, and the **digest** of the exact
 *   validated inputs, which the confirmation service already computed and which
 *   this host never needs a digest key to compare;
 * - the `occurredAt` the attempt was opened under, in ISO-8601 UTC;
 * - the challenge id currently live for that attempt, so a presentation can be
 *   routed back to the timestamp it belongs to.
 *
 * What it does not store: the inputs, the token, the utterance, the policy
 * verdict, or the executor's output. Nothing here is a place a value the visitor
 * typed can end up, which is what makes an attempt record safe to log and safe
 * to hand to a store another subsystem reads.
 *
 * The port is async and the host requires an explicit implementation. The
 * in-memory implementation below is for tests and offline reference use; a
 * deployment needs a durable store to preserve retry identity across restarts.
