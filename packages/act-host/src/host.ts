/**
 * The Act host — the only surface a visitor's envelope may reach.
 *
 * The seam this module holds is narrow and worth stating plainly. A browser is
 * not a peer: it is a caller that cannot be authenticated, cannot be believed
 * about who it is, and will eventually be operated by someone with devtools
 * open. So the host takes *two* kinds of input and treats them completely
 * differently.
 *
 * Server-owned inputs arrive in the constructor and cannot be changed per
 * request: the tenant, the session, the `ActionPolicy`, the capability tier, the
 * role, the entity resolver, the brain, the knowledge and structured-truth
 * ports, the composed tenant executor, the confirmation service, and the
 * attempt ledger. A browser asking to be served as another tenant, at another
 * tier, under another role, is not asking — it is misusing, and there is no
 * argument shape in which the answer is yes.
 *
 * Visitor-owned input arrives per request and is bounded by
 * {@link readVisitorEnvelope}: an utterance, exactly one action candidate, and
 * optionally the two strings a challenge minted. Everything else the body
 * carried is dropped and reported with a safe known name or generic marker.
 *
 * What the host does with them, in two calls:
 *
 * - `review` asks the gate whether a candidate action is eligible, validates
 *   its inputs against the registered contract, and — only for an action the
 *   policy answered `confirmation_required` for — mints exactly one challenge
 *   bound to the server-owned tenant, session and action id plus the digest of
 *   exactly the validated inputs, and records the attempt with the `occurredAt`
 *   the challenge was issued under.
 * - `present` spends that challenge. It re-reads the envelope, looks the
 *   attempt up by challenge id rather than by anything the visitor named,
 *   re-validates the presented inputs, verifies the challenge against the
 *   server-owned identity, and only then hands `runTurn` a request whose
 *   `requestedActions` is the one bound action and nothing else.
 *
 * `runTurn` remains the final gate. The host does not replace the policy, the
 * §9 validation, or entity resolution — it makes sure they are asked with the
 * right question. An action that survives to the executor has been asked three
 * times: once here, once in the service, once in the turn.
 *
 * The `occurredAt` guarantee lives or dies in one line, in
 * {@link ActHost.present}: the attempt's own recorded timestamp, read back from
 * the ledger. The host never calls its clock on the bound path. The clock it is
 * constructed with exists for `availableActions`, which runs a read-only probe
 * turn and produces no attempt at all.
