/**
 * Postmark, behind {@link EmailGateway}.
 *
 * The template, the sender and the recipient are not this file's to choose.
 * They arrive inside the existing `EmailSendRequest`, from a tenant resolver
 * reading server configuration (§9 and §18 already checked them), and this
 * adapter sends exactly those and nothing else. A model-written body, a
 * browser-chosen sender and a mid-flight recipient are all outside its
 * vocabulary: it writes only the fields Postmark requires for a template send.
 *
 * What this file is *for* is the answer to one question, honestly. Postmark
 * says three distinguishable things about a send — a `MessageID` it issued, a
 * refusal it described, and silence — and only the first is an acceptance:
 *
 * 1. **`accepted`, only with the id Postmark issued.** A success returns
 *    `MessageID` alongside `ErrorCode: 0`. That id is the receipt, and it is
 *    the only thing that makes a replay answerable without asking the provider
 *    again. A 200 whose payload carries no usable id is not an acceptance, and
 *    an id this package re-derived or invented would be worse than none.
 * 2. **`rejected` is Postmark answering no** — an unconfirmed sender, an
 *    unknown template, a malformed field, a rate limit. It said something this
 *    adapter can verify in the official documentation, and what it said was no.
 * 3. **Everything else is `unknown`.** A timeout, a connection that never
 *    established, a body that is not JSON, a 500 or a 503. Postmark's API
 *    overview documents a 500 as "an issue with Postmark's servers processing
 *    your request" and a 503 as "planned service outages" — neither says
 *    anything about whether this message was accepted, so neither becomes a
 *    refusal here. Silence stays silence.
 *
 * What this adapter will not do is send twice. `EmailOutboxBoundary` owns the
 * at-most-once rule: it claims the key, calls this gateway once, and settles
 * the attempt from whatever comes back. A retry here would be a second message
 * into a real mailbox, so there is no retry, no fallback request, and no second
 * body variant on failure — the outcome goes back as `unknown` and the boundary
 * decides what a replay may look at.
 *
 * **On the idempotency key.** Postmark documents no idempotency-key field, so
 * there is nowhere honest to put one. The upstream raw key is still transformed
 * — keyed, opaque, single-purpose — before it reaches any provider field, and
 * it travels as a metadata *label*: searchable in Postmark's outbound search,
 * and not something Postmark promises to deduplicate on. The at-most-once
 * guarantee stays with the attempt store, where it already lives.
 *
 * **On the server token.** Injected, per process, by a server that read it from
 * a secret store. It is never part of an error message, a reason string or a
 * log this package writes — only the one header Postmark requires. No
 * `process.env` read happens here, so a bundle that somehow reached this module
 * would find nothing to leak, and constructing one without a token is refused
 * rather than silently attempted.
