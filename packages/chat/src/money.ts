/**
 * Money, formatted for a visitor without restating what a live system said.
 *
 * A shell that draws an `order_summary` holds exactly one amount, paired by
 * schema with the currency it is in (§25's `amountMinor` + `currency` pair
 * exists so a number can never appear bare). That pairing is the whole problem:
 * "1250000" is meaningless, "Rp 1.438.000" is not — but which of those it is
 * depends on the currency's *minor unit*, not on the field name.
 *
 * IDR is the interesting case. Its minor unit is 1, so the reference tenant's
 * `amountMinor: 1_438_000` (`packages/reference/src/rates.ts`) is 1,438,000
 * whole rupiah, and a formatter that assumed two decimal places would print
 * `IDR 14,380` — off by a factor of a hundred, in the direction that under-quotes
 * a guest.
 *
 * So the divisor comes from `minorUnitExponent`, an explicit platform contract,
 * and never from `Intl`. That is the one thing this module refuses to do, and it
 * is worth saying in terms of the failure rather than the preference: the divisor
 * used to be read from
 * `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency }).formatToParts(1)`,
 * which makes the value of a *stored* price depend on the ICU dataset of the
 * machine printing it. CI and the laptop that wrote the code disagreed — IDR
 * gained two fraction digits on the runner and lost them locally — and the same
 * `amountMinor` meant two different prices. A stored amount is a fact about the
 * tenant's data; a locale's preference for symbol placement and digit grouping is
 * not, and letting the second decide the first is how a price under-quotes by a
 * hundred on one operating system and not another.
 *
 * `Intl` is still here, and still doing the half it is actually authoritative
 * for: taking the already-scaled major-unit number and presenting it in the
 * tenant's language (`Rp` grouping, `$` placement). Presentation may vary by ICU
 * dataset; the number being presented may not.
