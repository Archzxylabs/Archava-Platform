/**
 * The reference tenant: one client configuration, fixed.
 *
 * PRD §32 asks for a canonical showcase that walks the whole arc — land, ask,
 * understand, compare, decide, act, checkout, confirm, receipt, support. Doing
 * that on a live PMS is not a demo, it is a dependency. So the demo tenant is
 * a config like any other, declared here once and read by every slice that
 * needs one.
 *
 * Three things this file is careful about:
 *
 * - The raw literal is the only source. Entities, knowledge, and the tenant id
 *   are read back out of the parsed config rather than restated, so a bundled
 *   unit cannot drift from the config that governs it.
 * - `isReferenceImplementation` stays true. A config that looks like a real
 *   hotel must never be mistaken for one, by the pricing engine or by an
 *   operator.
 * - Nothing here contacts a network. Rates and availability in `rates.ts` are
 *   fixtures with a stated date, read through the same `StructuredTruthPort`
 *   a live PMS would answer through (§17).
