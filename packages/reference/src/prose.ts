/**
 * A structured-truth record as a sentence, for the reference tenant.
 *
 * The record the port resolves is the *authority*, and it is a record: a price
 * snapshot carries every unit's every night, because a snapshot cannot know which
 * one was asked about. Handing that to a visitor verbatim is what the browser E2E
 * showed — a chat bubble containing a JSON blob, which is not an answer, and a
 * blob that grows as the tenant adds a unit or a night.
 *
 * So the sentence is written here, in the tenant that owns the schema, rather
 * than in the brain adapter. An adapter must stay schema-agnostic: it can turn a
 * value into a string but it cannot know that `amountMinor` is money or that
 * 2_415_000 is a rate for the night of the 10th. This module knows both, because
 * `./rates.js` defines them.
 *
 * Two claims this file makes and keeps:
 *
 * 1. It selects; it never invents. Every number in the output comes from the
 *    record it was handed. When the question names a unit the record covers, the
 *    answer is that unit's figure. When it names none, the answer is the range
 *    across what the record does cover — and a range is what it is, not a
 *    representative angle drawn from the middle of it.
 * 2. It is partial by construction and says so. The record is what the port
 *    resolved at the time of the turn; a later live check could differ. The
 *    visitor is told the window, which is the honest way to say "these figures
 *    are live as of this turn" without stamping a time nobody measured.
