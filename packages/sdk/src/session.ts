/**
 * The session: the graph a single visitor's page accumulates.
 *
 * PRD §16 says the SDK "should maintain a normalized context graph", and the
 * graph in `@archava/core` is a pure reducer over events. That split matters, so
 * this module owns only the stateful half:
 *
 * - It holds the seed and the event history, and applies every event through the
 *   same `reduceContextGraph` the server uses. A graph assembled here and a graph
 *   replayed from the same history are identical, which is what makes a bug report
 *   answerable.
 * - It never invents a tenant. The tenant comes from `init`, because every read
 *   that follows is scoped to it (§23).
 * - It never collects without consent. Asking is cheap; asking *after* the fact is
 *   not consent.
