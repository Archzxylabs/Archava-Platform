/**
 * The production composition seam.
 *
 * Everything else in this package dispatches; this file is where a deployment
 * states, once, which tenant's gateways, stores and keys an executor may use —
 * and where an incomplete statement is refused instead of half-honoured.
 *
 * What it deliberately does **not** do: authorize. It does not read a policy, a
 * confirmation, a DecisionProvider score or a capability. The path is still
 *
 *   ActionPolicy → user confirmation → input validation → entity resolution
 *     → ActionExecutor
 *
 * and this factory sits below all four, wiring only the last one. An executor
 * built here tells the truth about a side effect or refuses to claim one; it
 * cannot grant permission, because permission was never asked of it.
 *
 * The one guarantee that is new: **the executor is bound to its tenant.** Every
 * request reaching it is checked against the tenant it was composed for, and a
 * request carrying another tenant's id is refused with no port call at all. The
 * port calls are tenant-scoped downstream too, so this is a second line rather
 * than the only one — but it is the line that catches a misrouted request before
 * it can be served.
 *
 * The wrappers are not optional. `BookingReplayBoundary` and
 * `EmailOutboxBoundary` are constructed here and their outputs are the only
 * gateways the executors are given; a deployment cannot hand this factory a raw
 * gateway and get a working executor, because a raw gateway is an argument to a
 * boundary, not to an executor.
