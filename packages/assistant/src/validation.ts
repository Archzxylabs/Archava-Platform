/**
 * Action input validation (PRD §18, V1.1).
 *
 * PRD §18 requires action inputs to be validated. This module is what closes
 * the gap between "the model named a field" and "the executor received a value
 * it can act on".
 *
 * Three properties define it, and each is a bug that was previously possible:
 *
 * 1. **It fails closed.** A missing field, a wrong type, or an unknown field is
 *    a refusal, never a best guess. A booking request with no slot is a booking
 *    request that did not happen, and saying so is better than filling the gap.
 *
 * 2. **Entity existence is verified against an authoritative resolver, never
 *    against a schema.** This is the trap §9 names: a zod schema describes the
 *    *shape* of an input, and `z.string().uuid()` will happily accept an id for
 *    a slot that does not exist. Whether a slot exists is a question only the
 *    catalog can answer, so it is asked — through {@link EntityResolver} — or the
 *    action is refused. A placeholder, a fixture, or a registry example passed in
 *    as though it were a catalog answer is the failure mode this prevents.
 *
 * 3. **Nothing is inferred from a registered action's example.** `requiredInputs`
 *    on an `ActionDefinition` is the model-facing contract — the list of names a
 *    model may be asked to fill. It is not a value, and no value is ever
 *    substituted for one the visitor did not supply.

/**
 * The port through which "does this thing exist" is answered.
 *
 * Implementable against a catalog, an availability system, or a product service.
 * Everything about it is tenant-scoped by the caller's responsibility to pass the
 * right `tenantId`: an id that exists for one tenant must resolve to nothing for
 * another, so an implementation that ignores the argument is broken in the §23
 * sense and not merely incomplete.
 *
 * Promise-returning. "Does this slot exist" is a question for a system, not for
 * this process, and a port typed to allow a bare `boolean` invites an
 * implementation that answers from whatever happens to be in memory — which is
 * the fixture-as-catalog failure §9 exists to catch. A local implementation
 * returns `Promise.resolve(answer)`.
