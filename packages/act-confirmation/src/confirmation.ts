/**
 * The confirmation service: what counts as a confirmation, and what does not.
 *
 * A confirmation is the statement *this tenant, in this session, agreed to this
 * action with exactly these inputs, inside this window*. Everything below is one
 * rule protecting one clause of that sentence, and the file is laid out in that
 * order: the shape, the inputs, the binding, the expiry, the store, and the
 * re-check of what the store said.
 *
 * What this package deliberately does not do is decide whether the underlying
 * action is *allowed* — that is `ActionPolicy`'s job, and a confirmation is not a
 * permission — and it does not run the action. It answers one question and hands
 * back a receipt. What a caller does with the receipt is the caller's business.
 *
 * The guarantee this file exists to hold is: **a verified confirmation cannot be
 * produced by anything but presenting a token this service minted, for the exact
 * thing it was minted for, inside its window, the first time it was presented.**
 * Anything that fails one clause is refused, and a refusal is always a refusal of
 * the same published vocabulary — never a receipt with fewer fields.
