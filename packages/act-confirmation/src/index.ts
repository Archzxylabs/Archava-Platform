/**
 * Server-side confirmation for state-changing Act actions.
 *
 * A confirmation answers one question — *did this tenant, in this session, agree
 * to this action with exactly these inputs, inside this window, presenting a token
 * this service minted, the first time it was presented?* — and answers it with a
 * receipt or a refusal.
 *
 * It is provider-neutral on purpose. There is no LLM here and no policy decision
 * here: a confirmation is not a permission, and this package does not grant one.
 * It is also the last thing standing between a plausible-looking request and a
 * state change, which is why every guarantee it makes is written down in
 * `confirmation.ts` with a test beside it in `test/`.
 *
 * What a host gets from here:
 *
 * - `ConfirmationService`, to mint and to verify.
 * - The store port, to be implemented against a durable store — one whose
 *   `consume` is genuinely atomic, which is the part a single-process test cannot
 *   prove and a reviewer must check.
 * - `ConfirmationReceipt`, to log or correlate. It carries the digests, never the
 *   payload.
