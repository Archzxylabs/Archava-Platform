/**
 * `apps/web`'s server: pages in, bundles out, one API route that prices.
 *
 * The shape is a single tsx-run process that compiles the browser bundles with
 * esbuild on the way past. Three modes, because "serve the source" and "serve a
 * build" are different jobs with different failure modes:
 *
 * - `dev` — compile on demand, keep the bundles in memory, log where to look.
 *   A dev server that writes `dist/` makes a directory nobody meant to keep.
 * - `build` — write `dist/` and exit. Nothing runs, because a build that starts
 *   serving is a deploy nobody asked for.
 * - `prod` — serve `dist/` and the API. Refuses to serve anything else.
 *
 * The alias table is the whole reason this file has to exist. `@archava/config`
 * exports a filesystem pricebook loader from its barrel, which cannot be
 * bundled for a browser at all, so the browser is handed the package's `pure`
 * entry: the same schemas minus the readers. Server code keeps the barrel,
 * because reading a file is fine under Node. That makes one package resolve two
 * ways in one app, and the only thing deciding which is where the import came
 * from — which is the honest way to put it: the schemas are shared, the readers
 * are not.
