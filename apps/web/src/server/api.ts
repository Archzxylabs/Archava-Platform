/**
 * The one route that has to run server-side, and the reason it is one.
 *
 * The studio answers questions with money in them. Pricing is deterministic out
 * of `@archava/pricing` reading a pricebook off disk, and the pricebook is the
 * authority — a browser cannot hold it without shipping it, and shipping it
 * would let anyone read the whole book and argue with the quote. So intake goes
 * up as JSON and the numbers come back the same way, which is also why this is
 * the only route in the app: everything else a page does runs in the visitor's
 * own browser, against a graph the visitor's own page produced.
 *
 * What this route is not: stateful. A POST in, a config set out, nothing kept.
 * Two identical posts get two identical answers, which is the property that
 * makes a quote reproducible from a saved intake.
