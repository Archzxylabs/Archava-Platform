/**
 * One command that answers "is this repo green?" (V1.1 §14).
 *
 * Every gate it runs is a script that already exists in `package.json`; this
 * file adds no checks of its own. That is deliberate: a verify script that
 * quietly re-implements a gate drifts from the one a developer runs by hand, and
 * the first thing to stop being true would be the claim that they are the same
 * run.
 *
 * Gates run in the order a change would break them: install, then the static
 * checks, then the ones that execute code. Install is special-cased to stop the
 * run early, because a failed install makes every later failure a symptom rather
 * than a finding.
 *
 * Usage: `pnpm verify` (or `node tools/scripts/verify.mjs`).
 * Exit code 0 means every gate passed; non-zero means at least one did not, and
 * the failing one is named in the summary.
