/**
 * The last step: a normalised scope becomes a `ClientConfig` the platform can
 * load (§14, §23).
 *
 * Two boundaries are deliberate and worth stating, because both look like gaps
 * until you read the reason:
 *
 * 1. **The configurator never invents a brand.** The template catalog carries
 *    no palette, and the intake asks for no colours, so `branding` and
 *    `updatedAt` arrive from the caller. An operator owns how a client looks and
 *    which day this snapshot is stamped; a configurator that made up a hex code
 *    would be writing brand decisions no client ever made. The core also stays
 *    clock-free, which is what keeps two runs on one intake identical.
 * 2. **Integrations are the client's, not the template's.** Only the
 *    integrations the intake required are emitted here. `ClientConfigResolver`
 *    is the one place template `common_integrations` and `modules` get merged
 *    in, so a resolved deployment can legitimately carry integrations the
 *    configurator never priced — the quote answers "what did the client ask
 *    for", the config answers "what is deployed", and conflating the two would
 *    misreport both.
