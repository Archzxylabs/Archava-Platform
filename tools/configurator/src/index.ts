/**
 * `@archava/configurator` — one entry point per consumer.
 *
 * The surface is deliberately flat. A caller wants one of three things: to turn
 * onboarding answers into intake (`parseIntake`), to price the variants those
 * answers imply (`buildConfigSet`), or to write the chosen one out as a tenant
 * config (`emitClientConfig`). Everything else is exported so a caller that
 * needs a stage on its own — a recommendation without a pricebook, a budget
 * verdict against a quote it already has — can take it without reaching past
 * the package.
