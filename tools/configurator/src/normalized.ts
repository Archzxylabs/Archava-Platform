/**
 * The one canonical scope record a launch is built from (§14, §23).
 *
 * Everything downstream of this point reads the same shape: the client-config
 * emitter does not re-derive anything from the intake, and the report does not
 * re-derive anything from the variant. A scope that goes through here comes out
 * the same for everyone who receives it, which is what makes two configurator
 * runs on one intake comparable rather than merely plausible.
 *
 * The rule that governs every field: **a value absent from the intake stays
 * absent.** The usage forecast is `null` when the client never stated one, not
 * `0` — pricing those two differently is the whole point. The same discipline
 * applies to integrations: only the ones the intake marked required for launch
 * are counted, and the rest are recorded in `provenance.omitted` with the reason
 * they were dropped, so nothing disappears without a trace.
