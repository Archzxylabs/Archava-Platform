# ARCHAVA Platform — Master Product Requirements Document

**Company:** ARCHZXY — AI-native Creative & Product Studio  
**Product:** Archava  
**Document version:** 1.0.0  
**Commercial baseline:** Pricing v1.0  
**Effective date:** 22 September 2026  
**Primary implementation workspace:** `/home/haikaru/Archverse/Lab/Archava_Platform/`  
**Status:** Build-ready baseline; pricing and provider economics require scheduled review.

---

## 1. Executive summary

Archava is ARCHZXY's reusable digital-employee platform for the web. It is not primarily a chatbot, avatar vendor, or website builder. Archava combines business knowledge, page awareness, customer context, realtime conversation, permitted actions, transaction orchestration, and optional human-looking realtime embodiment into one deployable experience.

The same Archava core must be sellable in three public **Presence** levels:

1. **Archava Chat** — text-based digital employee.
2. **Archava Voice** — Chat plus realtime spoken conversation.
3. **Archava Human** — Voice plus a realtime human-looking avatar.

Presence is intentionally separate from **Capability**:

1. **Assist** — understand, answer, recommend, compare, navigate, capture leads, hand off.
2. **Act** — Assist plus approved non-payment state-changing actions such as booking, form submission, CRM writes, transactional email, and standard API actions.
3. **Transact** — Act plus cart, checkout, payment initiation/status, confirmation, receipt, and supported post-purchase flows.
4. **Enterprise** — ERP, legacy, regulated, multi-system, dedicated-infrastructure, or otherwise complex custom orchestration.

Presence and Capability are also separate from the **Digital Environment** in which Archava lives:

- Existing client website
- Landing page
- Business website
- Commerce / booking environment
- Custom web application
- Enterprise system

This separation gives ARCHZXY a deterministic pricing and delivery system. The commercial formula is:

> **Implementation + Presence + Capability + Digital Environment + Integration Complexity + Consumption**

The platform must include an internal **Archava Studio** that accepts client requirements, selects the closest reusable template, enables the required modules, calculates an accurate quote from the machine-readable pricebook, and generates a proposal/configuration. The agent rules for this behavior are defined in `AGENT.md`.

---

## 2. Product thesis

### 2.1 What Archava is

Archava is an embodied business interface. A customer can ask natural-language questions, receive contextual answers, see personalized recommendations, navigate the website, trigger allowed actions, complete a transaction, receive confirmation/receipt, and return later for support.

The canonical end-to-end experience is:

`Discover → Ask → Understand → Compare → Decide → Act → Checkout/Book → Confirm → Receipt → Support → Return`

### 2.2 What ARCHZXY sells

ARCHZXY sells the **implemented business outcome**, not the underlying infrastructure vendor.

A client should buy:

- an intelligent customer-facing employee;
- integration into the client's website/business systems;
- optionally a website or web application built by ARCHZXY;
- ongoing platform operation and measured usage.

The client does **not** buy “Spatius integration”, “LiveKit integration”, “Gemini integration”, or a bundle of APIs. Provider names are implementation details unless the client asks for technical/procurement disclosure.

### 2.3 What must remain ARCHZXY IP

The following must remain first-party Archava logic and must not become inseparable from any single model/avatar vendor:

- context graph;
- page awareness;
- business/product knowledge model;
- customer/session memory abstraction;
- capability graph;
- permission/risk engine;
- outcome/journey engine;
- action registry;
- transaction orchestration;
- generative UI contracts;
- provider routing;
- business adapters;
- analytics/outcome taxonomy;
- template selection;
- commercial/pricing engine.

Provider implementations may be replaced without redefining the product.

---

## 3. Brand architecture

### ARCHZXY

**Positioning:** AI-native Creative & Product Studio.

ARCHZXY builds products, systems, creative experiences, websites, applications, and integrations for clients, while also developing proprietary products.

### Archava

**Positioning:** Digital employee / digital human platform for businesses.

Recommended product descriptor:

> **A realtime digital employee that understands your business, knows what your customer is looking at, and can help them all the way from question to action.**

For the public website, avoid leading with infrastructure terminology. Show the outcome first.

---

## 4. Goals

### 4.1 Product goals

Archava v1 must:

- work as Chat, Voice, or Human without changing the underlying business intelligence;
- understand the current webpage and relevant UI/business state;
- answer from structured business truth and unstructured knowledge;
- recommend and compare products/services contextually;
- execute only explicitly authorized actions;
- support lead capture and human handoff;
- support booking/action workflows;
- support end-to-end commerce/transaction flows when Transact is enabled;
- send transactional confirmations/receipts;
- expose useful analytics to the client;
- run on an existing website or an ARCHZXY-built environment;
- support a reusable template catalog for multiple industries;
- produce deterministic regional pricing from client requirements;
- be provider-agnostic for LLM/realtime voice/avatar infrastructure;
- fail gracefully from Human → Voice → Chat when required.

### 4.2 Business goals

The platform must let ARCHZXY:

- stop pricing projects ad hoc;
- quote a client quickly and consistently;
- reuse 70–90% of standard implementation work;
- preserve premium pricing despite lower infrastructure cost;
- sell in Indonesia with a localized IDR pricebook;
- sell globally with a separate USD pricebook;
- gradually shift from custom service revenue toward recurring Archava platform revenue;
- measure gross margin by client, provider, presence mode, and capability usage.

---

## 5. Non-goals for v1

Archava v1 will **not** attempt to:

- build a new foundational LLM;
- build a production-grade realtime avatar renderer from scratch;
- replace established ERP/accounting platforms;
- replace Shopify/WooCommerce/Medusa where a mature commerce engine already exists;
- replace client CRM/PMS systems unless explicitly contracted;
- provide unlimited usage plans;
- provide autonomous high-risk payments/refunds without explicit authorization policy;
- promise exact enterprise pricing without discovery;
- hard-code one industry into the core product;
- create a unique source-code fork for every standard client.

---

## 7. Commercial model

Archava pricing is intentionally modular, with four public/commercial dimensions.

### 7.1 Layer A — Presence

Presence answers: **How does the customer interact with Archava?**

#### Chat

Includes full Archava intelligence through text:

- business/product knowledge;
- page awareness;
- context;
- recommendations;
- supported actions according to capability level;
- lead capture;
- handoff;
- analytics.

#### Voice

Includes Chat plus:

- realtime audio conversation;
- interruption/barge-in;
- turn-taking;
- multilingual speech where provider supports it;
- graceful text fallback.

#### Human

Includes Voice plus:

- realtime human-looking avatar;
- one standard custom avatar setup within Presence setup where the selected provider/plan supports it;
- graceful Human → Voice → Chat fallback;
- client-side/network capability checks.

A realistic avatar must still be disclosed as AI in the UI where applicable.

### 7.2 Layer B — Capability

Capability answers: **What is Archava allowed to do?**

#### Assist — included

- Q&A;
- structured/unstructured product knowledge;
- page awareness;
- product/service recommendations;
- comparisons;
- navigation and UI guidance;
- lead capture;
- human handoff;
- baseline analytics.

#### Act — paid module

Includes Assist plus:

- booking/appointment actions;
- form submission;
- CRM writes;
- transactional email;
- standard external API state-changing actions;
- configurable approval/confirmation rules.

Includes one Standard integration in the list price.

#### Transact — paid module

Includes Act plus:

- catalog/cart actions;
- checkout orchestration;
- payment initiation;
- payment status;
- order/booking confirmation;
- receipt/transactional email;
- order/booking lookup;
- supported post-purchase transaction actions.

Includes two Standard integrations in the list price.

#### Enterprise

Used when requirements involve:

- ERP;
- legacy/undocumented systems;
- advanced multi-system workflows;
- dedicated deployment;
- strict compliance/SLA;
- complex identity/SSO;
- large data migration;
- custom multi-agent orchestration;
- high or unusual concurrency;
- advanced permission/audit requirements.

Enterprise is never auto-priced as a final fixed quote.

### 7.3 Layer C — Digital Environment

Answers: **Where does Archava live?**

#### Existing Site

One normal Archava embed into a suitable existing production website is included in Presence setup.

Additional remediation is charged separately if the website requires:

- extensive DOM reconstruction;
- custom routing instrumentation;
- framework migration;
- security remediation;
- duplicated/unstable UI state;
- unsupported/legacy architecture.

#### Landing

Target scope:

- one primary conversion page;
- responsive design;
- basic SEO;
- analytics;
- CTA/forms;
- legal/privacy essentials;
- lightweight CMS where necessary.

#### Business

Target scope:

- approximately 2–8 primary pages;
- CMS;
- services/products content;
- forms;
- analytics;
- SEO foundations;
- reusable design system.

#### Commerce / Booking

Target scope:

- catalog or service listing;
- detail views;
- booking/cart conversion flow;
- admin/content management;
- transaction-ready integration points.

Commerce engine/payment/PMS fees are not automatically included.

#### Custom Web App

Used when the project needs:

- user accounts;
- dashboards;
- custom data models;
- multi-role workflows;
- complex application behavior.

Published prices are “from” only.

#### Enterprise System

Custom scope only.

### 7.4 Layer D — Consumption

No public Archava plan is unlimited.

Usage must be metered separately from platform pricing.

Definitions are in `config/pricing.v1.json`.

Standard v1 meters:

- Chat → active conversations;
- Voice → realtime minutes;
- Human → realtime human/avatar minutes.

Third-party payment transaction fees and extraordinary external provider charges are separate.

---

## 8. Regional pricebooks

ARCHZXY must maintain separate commercial pricebooks rather than FX-converting one list into another.

### 8.1 Global pricebook — USD

#### Presence

| Presence | Setup | Monthly platform | Included usage | Overage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Chat | $2,000 | $249/mo | 1,000 active conversations | $0.10/conversation |

|---|---:|
| Standard | Rp2.500.000 |
| Custom | from Rp5.000.000 |
| Advanced | from Rp10.000.000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

### 8.3 Regional selection rule

Use Indonesia pricing only when:

- contracting/billing entity is in Indonesia **and** primary commercial delivery market is Indonesia; or
- ARCHZXY explicitly authorizes the Indonesia pricebook.

Otherwise use Global pricing.

Do not convert Global USD list prices directly to IDR as a substitute for the Indonesia pricebook.

The public website may default to a suggested regional view, but users must be able to switch pricing region manually.

Recommended routes:

- Global: `/pricing`
- Indonesia: `/id/pricing`

---

## 9. Discounts, bundles, floors, and quote validity

### 9.1 Automatic bundle discounts

Automatic discounts apply only to **fixed-price standard core setup modules**.

- Presence + one additional paid core component = **5% off eligible one-time core setup**.
- Presence + paid Environment + paid Capability = **10% off eligible one-time core setup**.

Paid core components are:

- Presence;
- fixed-price paid Environment;
- Act or Transact.

No auto-discount applies to:

- usage/overage;
- integrations;
- third-party pass-through;
- tax;
- premium provider charges;
- custom engineering;
- `setup_from` work;
- Enterprise work.

### 9.2 Annual recurring discount

Annual prepayment receives **10% off eligible recurring platform fees**.

Usage and overage remain pay-as-used and are not discounted by annual prepayment.

### 9.3 Discount authority

The automated agent has **zero discretionary discount authority** beyond the defined bundle and annual-prepay rules.

If a client asks for a lower price:

1. reduce scope;
2. choose a lower Presence tier where appropriate;
3. choose a lower Capability level where requirements permit;
4. simplify Environment;
5. remove optional integrations/add-ons.

Do not silently discount the same scope.

A human may authorize special discounting, but standard setup must not fall below **80% of list setup** without explicit founder/authorized approval.

### 9.4 Quote validity

Standard generated quotations are valid for **14 days**.

Provider pass-through prices and third-party fees may be revalidated at contract signing.

---

## 10. Recommended client-facing bundles

Bundles are marketing shortcuts, not separate architecture.

The pricing engine still calculates the underlying modules.

### Website Concierge

Typical:

- Chat
- Assist
- Landing or existing website

### AI Receptionist

Typical:

- Voice
- Act
- Business environment
- calendar/booking + transactional email

### Digital Human

Typical:

- Human
- Act
- Business environment
- one or more standard actions

### AI Commerce

Typical:

- Human
- Transact
- Commerce environment
- commerce/payment + transactional email

### Enterprise Digital Employee

Custom:

- any Presence;
- complex Capability;
- custom environment;
- legacy/ERP/dedicated infra;
- custom SLA.

Public pricing cards should remain simple. A “Configure Archava” flow should reveal the modular layers only after the user engages.

---

## 11. Deterministic pricing calculation

The source of truth is `config/pricing.v1.json`.

### 11.1 One-time price

`eligible_core_setup = presence.setup + fixed_environment.setup + fixed_capability.setup`

Bundle discount:

- one paid core component: 0%;
- two paid core components: 5%;
- three paid core components: 10%.

Then:

`one_time_total = discounted_core_setup + chargeable_integrations + design_addons + custom_engineering`

Round once at final quote level:

- Global → nearest $50;
- Indonesia → nearest Rp100.000.

### 11.2 Monthly base price

`monthly_base = presence.monthly + capability.monthly + selected_support.monthly`

Environment has no standard recurring fee in pricing v1.

Third-party services may be pass-through or client-owned subscriptions.

### 11.3 Integration calculation

`included_standard_integrations` comes from Capability.

Only Standard integrations may consume the included allowance.

Examples:

- Act with Cal.com only → no extra integration charge.
- Act with Cal.com + HubSpot → one Standard integration is included, one is charged.
- Transact with Shopify + Midtrans → both Standard integrations included.
- Transact with Shopify + Midtrans + custom legacy ERP → Shopify/Midtrans included; legacy ERP is Advanced and charged separately.

Custom/Advanced integrations never consume the free Standard integration allowance.

### 11.4 Usage forecast

The base monthly price includes standard usage.

If forecast usage exceeds the included quantity, the quote must show:

- base recurring price;
- included usage;
- estimated overage separately;
- unit overage rate.

Do not hide expected usage charges inside a single monthly number.

---

## 12. Example calculations

### 12.1 Indonesia — Chat + Landing + Assist

List setup:

- Chat: Rp6.900.000
- Landing: Rp4.900.000
- Assist: included

Two paid core components → 5% bundle discount.

`(6.900.000 + 4.900.000) × 0,95 = 11.210.000`

Rounded → **Rp11.200.000 setup**.

Monthly → **Rp1.490.000/bln** plus overage above 1,000 active conversations.

### 12.2 Indonesia — Voice + Business + Act

List setup:

- Voice: Rp10.900.000
- Business: Rp8.900.000
- Act: Rp4.900.000

Three paid core components → 10% bundle discount.

`24.700.000 × 0,90 = 22.230.000`

Rounded → **Rp22.200.000 setup**.

Monthly:

`2.490.000 + 750.000 = Rp3.240.000/bln`

Act includes one Standard integration.

### 12.3 Indonesia — Human + Commerce + Transact

List setup:

- Human: Rp14.900.000
- Commerce: Rp14.900.000
- Transact: Rp9.900.000

Three paid core components → 10% bundle discount.

`39.700.000 × 0,90 = 35.730.000`

Rounded → **Rp35.700.000 setup**.

Monthly:

`3.490.000 + 1.500.000 = Rp4.990.000/bln`

Includes two Standard integrations.

### 12.4 Global — Voice + Business + Act

List setup:

- Voice: $3,500
- Business: $3,000
- Act: $1,500

Three components → 10% bundle discount.

`$8,000 × 0.90 = $7,200 setup`

Monthly:

`$399 + $149 = $548/mo`

---

## 13. Template catalog

Source of truth: `config/templates.v1.json`.

Initial templates:

1. Generic Business
2. Hospitality / Hotel / Villa / Resort
3. Restaurant / F&B
4. Clinic / Dental / Wellness
5. Real Estate
6. E-commerce / Retail
7. Professional Services / B2B
8. Education / Courses

Templates are not independent codebases. They are compositions of:

- page presets;
- data schemas;
- content types;
- Archava modules;
- recommended integrations;
- default Presence/Capability suggestions;
- design variants.

A client implementation selects the closest template and then toggles modules.

### 13.1 Template-selection principle

Do not create a new template merely because a client has a different brand.

Create a new template only when:

- the information architecture is materially different;
- the workflow/capability graph is materially different;
- three or more clients are likely to reuse the pattern; or
- the existing template would require extensive exceptions.

---

## 14. Archava Studio requirements

Archava Studio is an internal ARCHZXY application, not the client CMS.

### 14.1 New-client configurator

Inputs:

- client name;
- market/region;
- industry;
- existing website URL/status;
- business goals;
- Presence preference;
- actions required;
- transaction requirements;
- expected traffic/usage;
- languages;
- required integrations;
- brand assets;
- compliance/security needs;
- custom design requirements;
- target launch date;
- known budget (optional).

### 14.2 Studio outputs

The Studio must produce:

- selected primary template;
- selected Environment;
- Presence;
- Capability;
- selected modules;
- integration classification;
- implementation assumptions;
- one-time price;
- monthly base price;
- included usage and overage;
- annual-prepay option;
- implementation notes;
- machine-readable client config;
- proposal-ready summary.

### 14.3 Pricebook behavior

Studio must read prices from versioned config. No price may be hardcoded in UI logic.

A quote must record:

- pricebook version;
- effective date;
- selected region;
- quote generation date;
- validity end date.

### 14.4 Configuration modes

Studio should eventually support:

- form/wizard mode;
- expert JSON/YAML import/export;
- clone existing client configuration;
- compare two configurations;
- generate recommended/budget/premium variants.

---

## 15. Client Admin requirements

The client-facing admin is separate from Archava Studio.

Client Admin should provide role-controlled access to:

- pages/content;
- products/services where applicable;
- media;
- FAQ/knowledge sources;
- leads;
- bookings/orders where applicable;
- Archava conversations/outcomes;
- handoff queues;
- analytics;
- permission/settings allowed for the client's role.

Client users must not receive access to:

- ARCHZXY provider secrets;
- global pricing configuration;
- cross-tenant data;
- internal margin/COGS data;
- unsupported action permissions;
- raw system prompts unless intentionally exposed.

---

## 16. Page awareness and Context Graph

Page awareness is a core Archava differentiator.

The SDK should maintain a normalized context graph containing, when available:

- current route/page;
- current section/viewport;
- visible product/service entities;
- selected item/variant;
- comparison state;
- form state;
- cart state;
- checkout step;
- authenticated customer context;
- previous interaction/session context;
- known UI errors;
- active modal/panel;
- available actions on the page.

Primary context source should be structured SDK/DOM/application state, with vision as a fallback or enhancement—not the sole source of truth.

Sensitive fields must be masked before model/provider exposure according to policy.

---

## 17. Knowledge architecture

Archava must distinguish **structured truth** from **retrieval knowledge**.

### Structured truth

Must be read from live authoritative sources where relevant:

- price;
- stock;
- availability;
- booking status;
- customer/order data;
- payment status;
- shipping status;
- account state.

Do not answer these from stale vector retrieval when a live system exists.

### Retrieval knowledge

Use for:

- FAQs;
- product descriptions;
- service explanations;
- policies;
- manuals;
- brochures;
- training documents;
- public website content.

Selected baseline:

- PostgreSQL + pgvector;
- Gemini Embedding-class provider by adapter;
- Firecrawl for public-web ingestion;
- Docling for document parsing;
- source provenance stored per chunk/document.

Every answer should be able to preserve source provenance internally for debugging/evals.

---

## 18. Action, capability, and permission model

Every external action must be registered with:

- capability name;
- tenant;
- description;
- required inputs;
- risk level;
- confirmation mode;
- allowed roles;
- idempotency behavior;
- audit behavior;
- failure/rollback strategy where available.

Recommended action levels:

- **L0 Read** — product/availability/order status.
- **L1 UI** — navigate, highlight, filter, compare.
- **L2 Reversible** — fill draft, add/remove cart item.
- **L3 External state** — send form, create booking, send email, CRM write.
- **L4 Money/account** — checkout, payment, cancellation, refund, shipping/account changes.
- **L5 Admin** — never autonomous by default.

Capability tier does not override risk rules. A Transact client still requires appropriate confirmation for L4 actions.

---

## 19. Transaction lifecycle

For Transact implementations, Archava should support a state machine such as:

`discovery → selection → cart → checkout → payment_pending → payment_confirmed → confirmation_sent → fulfillment/support`

Required characteristics:

- idempotent transaction actions;
- server-side validation;
- no client-supplied price as authoritative truth;
- payment provider webhook verification;
- order/booking identifier captured from authoritative backend;
- transactional receipt/confirmation;
- error recovery;
- human handoff if policy or state requires it.

Payment gateway fees are merchant/client costs unless contracted otherwise.

For Indonesia, Midtrans is the default payment adapter baseline; alternatives such as Xendit remain supported by adapter.

---

## 20. Durable workflows

Some flows outlive a realtime conversation.

Examples:

- payment pending;
- reminder tomorrow;
- abandoned booking follow-up;
- human approval;
- refund review;
- order/shipping notification;
- post-purchase sequence.

Selected baseline: **Trigger.dev** for v1.

Workflows must be resumable, retryable, observable, and tenant-scoped.

Do not couple durable business workflows to the lifetime of a LiveKit room or model session.

---

## 21. Presence provider architecture

Presence is a replaceable adapter.

### v1 default

- Realtime transport/orchestration: LiveKit
- Realtime AI brain: Gemini Live-class provider through adapter
- Default Human rendering: Spatius
- Premium renderer option: Tavus or approved alternative

Spatius must not be hardcoded outside the provider adapter because:

- vendor terms/pricing may change;
- client device/network requirements vary;
- premium clients may require a different embodiment provider.

The frontend must run a Human-mode preflight:

- renderer support;
- network reachability;
- session token/bootstrap;
- basic performance readiness.

On failure:

`Human → Voice → Chat`

Archava must remain usable.

---

## 22. Technical baseline

### Application / monorepo

- Nx + pnpm
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind + private shadcn registry
- Storybook for reusable UI/component review

### CMS/admin

- Payload
- multi-tenant architecture

### Data

- Neon PostgreSQL
- pgvector
- Drizzle
- Upstash Redis for ephemeral/cache/rate-limit/locks
- Cloudflare R2 for files/media

### Realtime

- LiveKit Agents
- provider abstraction for realtime model
- provider abstraction for avatar/presence

### Durable background work

- Trigger.dev

### Integrations

- Postmark transactional email default
- Midtrans Indonesia payment default
- Xendit/Stripe adapters
- Cal.com appointment adapter
- Shopify/WooCommerce/Medusa commerce adapters
- CRM adapters
- ERPNext/Frappe adapter for ERP-oriented deployments rather than rebuilding generic ERP

### Analytics/observability

- PostHog product analytics
- OpenTelemetry
- Arize Phoenix OSS for AI traces/evals
- Sentry for application errors/performance

### Security/dev tooling

- Infisical or equivalent secret management
- GitHub Actions
- Vitest
- pytest + Ruff + MyPy for Python services
- Playwright E2E
- k6 load testing
- Semgrep
- Trivy
- OWASP ZAP staging scans

---

## 23. Multi-tenancy

Standard clients should default to a shared platform/tenant model when requirements permit.

Each tenant must isolate:

- content;
- knowledge;
- customer data;
- sessions;
- conversations;
- integrations;
- secrets references;
- permissions;
- analytics;
- pricing/contract metadata.

Enterprise clients may use dedicated deployment/database/storage when contracted.

No cross-tenant retrieval is permitted.

---

## 24. Archava Web SDK

The SDK must be installable into an existing site with minimal friction.

Target API concept:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.archava.example/sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  Archava.init({ clientId: "client_xyz" })
</script>
```

Implementation should use strong style isolation (for example Shadow DOM where suitable) and expose integrations for modern app frameworks.

SDK responsibilities:

- initialize UI/presence;
- collect approved page context;
- synchronize route/section/entity state;
- receive UI actions;
- render highlights/generative UI surfaces;
- handle presence fallback;
- emit analytics;
- respect consent/privacy settings.

SDK must never expose server API keys.

---

## 25. Generative UI

Generative UI is a strategic differentiator, but must be schema-controlled rather than arbitrary model-generated frontend code.

Archava should be able to request trusted UI primitives such as:

- recommendation list;
- comparison table;
- booking picker;
- product shortlist;
- order summary;
- FAQ/source card;
- CTA;
- human handoff card.

Model output selects from a validated registry and supplies validated props. It does not execute arbitrary client-side code.

---

## 26. Human handoff

Handoff must preserve context.

Staff should receive:

- customer identity where permitted;
- reason for handoff;
- concise conversation summary;
- selected product/service/order;
- actions already attempted;
- current page/context;
- errors/failure state.

The customer should not need to repeat the entire story.

Handoff events must be tracked in analytics.

---

## 27. Analytics and outcomes

Client dashboard should evolve beyond message counts.

Minimum events:

- conversation_started;
- meaningful_question_answered;
- recommendation_shown;
- comparison_started;
- lead_captured;
- booking_started;
- booking_completed;
- cart_action;
- checkout_started;
- transaction_completed;
- receipt_sent;
- handoff_requested;
- handoff_completed;
- knowledge_gap;
- tool_failure;
- presence_fallback.

Derived metrics:

- conversation → lead conversion;
- conversation → booking conversion;
- conversation → transaction conversion;
- revenue influenced where attribution is defensible;
- handoff rate;
- answer success/knowledge gap rate;
- common objections;
- frequently compared products;
- drop-off stage;
- provider cost per successful outcome.

Outcome-based billing may be offered for custom Enterprise contracts later, but v1 public pricing remains platform + usage.

---

## 28. Security and privacy requirements

Mandatory:

- server-side secrets only;
- tenant-scoped authorization;
- least privilege;
- explicit tool allowlists;
- action-level permission checks;
- audit logs for state-changing actions;
- idempotency for sensitive actions;
- rate limits;
- safe provider failover;
- prompt/tool injection defenses;
- PII masking/minimization where appropriate;
- retention controls;
- authenticated webhook verification;
- dependency/SAST/container/DAST checks;
- AI disclosure for realistic avatar interactions where required.

High-risk business actions must not rely solely on natural-language intent without confirmation/policy checks.

---

## 29. Reliability and performance targets

Initial targets, to be validated in production:

- graceful session recovery/fallback;
- 99.9% platform target for standard hosted control-plane components after production maturity;
- Human preflight failure must not make Chat/Voice unavailable;
- tool calls must have timeouts/retries appropriate to action type;
- transaction actions must be idempotent;
- realtime sessions must expose latency telemetry;
- page-awareness event processing must not noticeably degrade page performance.

Performance metrics:

- time to Archava UI ready;
- time to realtime connection;
- time to first spoken response;
- turn latency;
- avatar first frame;
- avatar FPS/client performance;
- tool latency;
- checkout completion latency;
- fallback rate.

---

## 30. Testing strategy

### Unit

- pricing calculator;
- template classifier;
- capability classification;
- integration classification;
- permission engine;
- provider adapters;
- context normalization.

### Contract/integration

- LiveKit/model/avatar provider contracts;
- payment gateway webhooks;
- email;
- calendar;
- commerce;
- CRM.

### E2E

At minimum test:

- Chat Assist on existing site;
- Voice Act booking flow;
- Human Transact commerce flow;
- payment success;
- payment failure;
- receipt email;
- handoff;
- Human → Voice fallback;
- stale/incorrect knowledge protection;
- tenant isolation.

### Commercial-engine tests

Every pricebook release must test:

- Global and Indonesia quotes;
- bundle discounts;
- integration allowance;
- rounding;
- annual prepay;
- overage;
- custom/Enterprise stop conditions.

---

## 31. Reference products

The platform should ship with reference configurations, not separate forks:

1. **Archava Stay** — hospitality/resource booking.
2. **Archava Clinic** — services/appointments.
3. **Archava Realty** — lead qualification/viewings.
4. **Archava Store** — commerce/checkout/post-purchase.

Each reference must exercise a materially different workflow. The purpose is to prove the platform is generic and prevent White-Rock-specific assumptions from returning to the core.

---

## 32. Canonical showcase

The flagship Archava demo should show the product end-to-end rather than only the avatar.

Recommended scenario:

1. Customer lands on product/service page.
2. Archava knows what is visible.
3. Customer asks an ambiguous contextual question.
4. Archava resolves the reference correctly.
5. Archava recommends/compares options.
6. The UI adapts to the recommendation.
7. Customer selects.
8. Archava performs permitted action/cart/booking.
9. Customer proceeds to checkout/payment.
10. Payment succeeds.
11. Archava confirms and sends receipt/confirmation email.
12. Customer asks a post-purchase question.
13. Archava answers from order/booking truth.

This is the minimum demo that proves Archava is not merely a talking avatar.

---

## 34. Acceptance criteria for v1 commercial readiness

Archava v1 is commercially ready when:

- all three Presence modes work through one shared intelligence core;
- at least four reference configurations run without industry hardcoding;
- requirement → template → module selection is deterministic;
- price calculator matches pricebook tests exactly;
- quotes clearly separate setup, monthly, usage, third-party/pass-through, and tax;
- Human falls back gracefully;
- page awareness works on at least one existing-site embed and one ARCHZXY environment;
- Act can complete one booking/CRM/email workflow;
- Transact can complete one full payment → confirmation → receipt workflow;
- tenant isolation tests pass;
- critical security scanning/tests pass;
- observability captures model/tool/action traces;
- provider costs can be measured per tenant;
- proposal generation can be produced from a client brief without manually inventing a price.

---

## 35. Commercial and pricing review schedule

Pricebook is versioned independently from product code.

Review at least quarterly, and immediately if:

- default model pricing materially changes;
- Spatius/default avatar pricing materially changes;
- LiveKit/hosting cost materially changes;
- gross margin falls below internal target;
- global or Indonesia close rates indicate systematic mispricing;
- a new package creates recurring delivery exceptions.

Do not change old signed contracts retroactively unless contract terms permit it.

---

## 36. Research basis and market anchors

This baseline was informed by current 2026 market/provider data, including:

- Clutch September 2026 pricing guides: typical web projects on the platform commonly below $10k; reviewed software/AI projects often in the $10k–$49k/$49.999 range.
- Intercom Fin 2026 outcome pricing: $0.99 common Fin outcomes and higher pricing for qualified sales outcomes, demonstrating movement toward value/outcome pricing.
- Paddle localized pricing documentation: explicit country-level pricing overrides based on willingness to pay/purchasing power rather than only FX conversion.
- Stripe Adaptive Pricing: reported international revenue uplift from localized pricing, supporting localized buyer experience.
- Spatius September 2026 public pricing: very low avatar-rendering economics, commercial usage on paid plans, and high included-minute tiers.
- LiveKit official Spatius integration: client-side rendering and native LiveKit Agents integration.
- Midtrans public Indonesia pricing: no implementation/monthly fee for payment service; merchant pays transaction fees per successful payment method.
- Payload official multi-tenant plugin: tenant-scoped collections/admin behavior.
- Trigger.dev public pricing/docs: long-running resilient tasks without standard timeouts and optional self-hosting.
- Cloudflare R2 public pricing: low object-storage cost with no egress-bandwidth charge.
- PostHog public usage model: generous free analytics/session-replay tiers suitable for early deployments.

Provider/market evidence is used to set a rational baseline, not to guarantee future third-party pricing. Machine-readable ARCHZXY pricebooks remain the authoritative quote source.

---

## 37. Source-of-truth hierarchy

For implementation and quoting, use this precedence:

1. `config/pricing.v1.json` — prices and commercial rules.
2. `config/templates.v1.json` — template/module defaults.
3. `AGENT.md` — deterministic selection/quotation behavior.
4. This PRD — product/architecture requirements.
5. Client-specific signed Statement of Work / contract.

If a contradiction exists, stop automatic finalization and flag the conflict for ARCHZXY review.

---

## 38. Final product rule

A standard client should feel that ARCHZXY built a tailored digital employee for their business, while ARCHZXY should feel that it configured and extended a repeatable platform rather than rebuilding the product from scratch.

That is the core productization test for Archava.
